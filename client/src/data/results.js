    text: `Be careful though – lower prices don’t always give you the best value, and the pros and cons of different financial products are not always obvious. Why not try using an independent comparison tool - like that offered by Defaqto – which shows the full range of benefits a product offers? For example, not understanding what insurance policy you’re buying can lead to being under-covered, which can have disastrous financial consequences. Chatting to a professional financial adviser online, by phone, or by video call, is a safe way to find financial products that are right for you. Advisers can also check whether your existing products are still fit for purpose.`,

If you haven’t already, National Conversation Week is the perfect time to get chatting to a financial adviser. You may already be familiar with independent comparison tools, such as Defaqto Compare.`,

    text: `We get it  – there are other ways to spend your free time than searching for the right financial product – but be careful you don’t end up with products that don’t meet your needs. For example, the wrong insurance policy would leave you under-covered and at risk. Why not take advantage of any extra spare time you have by talking to an adviser this National Conversation Week, and leave the policy hunting to the experts? They can discuss your options safely over the phone or by video call. You can also use easy, independent comparison tools like Defaqto to fully understand the benefits of financial products.`,
